# Requests: Embedded code URLs do not load the request queue correctly

When a user uses an embedded code URL to go to a request queue, the queue loads, but none of the associated fields load, and the user cannot fill out the request. This occurs when the project that the queue belongs to has more than one queue associated with it.

**Solución**

The direct access URL for the request queue works as expected.
